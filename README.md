# Recommendation-using-Collaborative-Filtering
What is a recommendation system?
Recommendation systems predict the products or services that users would buy or consume. The recommendation system is very highly used in e-commerce, entertainment content, social media posts, advertisements, music, etc.
Types of system
There are mainly two types of recommendation systems.
Collaborative-based Filtering
Content-based Filtering
What is Collaborative Filtering?
Recommendation systems use collaborative filtering to find similar patterns or information of the users, this technique can filter out items that users like based on the ratings or reactions of similar users.
The approach works by analyzing large sets of data to find patterns and relationships between users and items and then using those patterns to predict which items a user is likely to be interested in.
We will be implementing collaborative filtering using PyTorch in Python.
